    "test" : "India wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant has said someone from the crowd threw a ball on pacer Mohammed Siraj while he was fielding in the ongoing third Test against England on Wednesday. Pant revealed the incident made India skipper Virat Kohli "upset". "I think, somebody threw a ball inside, at Siraj, so he [Kohli] was upset," said Pant in a virtual press conference after the close of the first day's play."You can say whatever you want to chant, but don't throw things at the fielders and all those things. It is not good for cricket, I guess," he added.In the third session of the opening day of the third Test, a section of spectators seemed to have asked Siraj the score of the match to tease the pacer. The India pacer however came with a brilliant reply as he gestured 1-0 (India leading the Test series) towards the crowd.Earlier this month, during the second Test match, there was some bad crowd behaviour on a show as some unruly fans threw champagne corks at India batsman KL Rahul.Kohli also intervened and he was seen gesturing towards the opening batsman to know more about the incident."
